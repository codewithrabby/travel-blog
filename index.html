    <h3 class="quote">Man Cannot discover new oceans unless he has the courage to lose sight of the shore.</h3>
    <h2>People love to travel around the world for leisure while there are people who travel for educational purposes. At the same time, some people travel for work-related reasons. All those people who love to travel for educational purposes get the opportunity to their classroom learning into practical use as well.</h2>

            <h3>Hello! I'm Rabby, I am a passionate traveler who believes that the world is meant to be explored.
        For me, every journey is a new story, a new experience, and a new lesson.
        I find joy in discovering unknown places, meeting new people, and learning about different cultures.
        Traveling allows me to step out of my comfort zone and truly live in the moment.
        Whether it's a calm beach, a dense forest, or a busy city street, every place has its own charm.
        I love capturing memories through photos and sharing my experiences with others.
        Every destination I visit teaches me something valuable about life and about myself.
        Wanderlust runs through my veins, and my heart feels at home on the road.
        I believe that traveling makes us more humble, open-minded, and connected to the world.
        This is not just a hobby for meâ€”its a way of life. .</h3>
